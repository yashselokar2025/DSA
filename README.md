📌 DSA Practice Repository
📖 About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to my daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C/C++.
I consistently solve problems starting from basic programming concepts and gradually move towards core DSA topics, focusing on logic building and problem-solving skills.

🎯 Purpose

Practice DSA every day

Strengthen fundamental programming concepts

Prepare for technical interviews

Maintain a structured and disciplined learning path

📂 Repository Structure

Contains beginner to intermediate DSA programs

Covers:

Basic input/output programs

Arithmetic operations

Patterns

Conditional logic

Loops

Core DSA concepts (progressively)

Each program is written clearly for easy understanding and revision

👉 Array-related problems are maintained in a separate repository to keep this repository clean, modular, and well-organized.

🛠️ Technologies Used

C

C++

Standard input/output based programs

🚀 Learning Approach

Solve problems daily

Focus on logic first, syntax later

Improve time & space efficiency gradually

Write clean and readable code
